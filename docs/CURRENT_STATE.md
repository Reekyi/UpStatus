# UpStatus Current State

> This is a handoff snapshot, not a substitute for checking live state. Re-verify branches, PRs, checks, and deployments before acting.

## Verified baseline at documentation setup

- Repository: `Reekyi/UpStatus`.
- Release file on `master`: `release.json` reports version `3.0.31`, no prerelease suffix.
- README release policy: `master` is production/stable; `develop` is integration/TEST; normal feature branches and PRs target `develop`; production deployment is manual.
- Latest relevant merged change observed: PR #11, "Fix Lucca call controls and improve call startup reliability", merge commit `c509277911b862d8624310f4d0acff56bea98b8c`.
- Its release version follow-up PR #12 was merged as `1e81a39d436b6e854a3e5172c0247a23e2f20ac5`.
- Vercel status check for commit `c509277911b862d8624310f4d0acff56bea98b8c` reported success and its production deployment metadata showed READY, alias `upstatus-lucca.vercel.app`, production target.
- Supabase production Edge Function `upstatus` was deployed to ACTIVE version 393 with version `3.0.31` and the updated userscript embedded. The active function source was retrieved and checked to contain the userscript update.
- Latest Lucca call fixes: corrected microphone icon state, removed injected call controls from the top header, and waited for Supabase Realtime subscription before outgoing call startup, with a clear timeout message.
- User reported the Lucca calls were working "100%" after the previous fixes. This is user-reported real-world success, not a universal connectivity guarantee.

## Known architectural constraints

- Lucca portal: `lucca-site/index.html`, served by Vercel project `upstatus-lucca`.
- Userscript source: `src/userscript/upstatus.user.template.js`.
- Supabase function source template: `src/server/index.template.ts`.
- Build/version authority: `release.json` and `scripts/build.mjs`; validation: `scripts/validate.mjs`.
- Supabase project ID: `dlfvkawaiqduhlazsszm`.
- Production function slug: `upstatus`; TEST function slug: `upstatus-test`.
- Do not print or store credentials/secrets in this file.
- README specifies feature PRs to `develop`, separate TEST identifiers and manual production deployment. Confirm the current release strategy before making future production changes.

## Stable Ycaro release preparation (2026-10-09)

- Created release branch `release/ycaro-3.0.32` from stable `master` commit `1e81a39d436b6e854a3e5172c0247a23e2f20ac5`, and opened draft PR #18 targeting `master`: https://github.com/Reekyi/UpStatus/pull/18.
- PR #18 bumps the stable version from `3.0.31` to `3.0.32`, adds `ycaro.html`, embeds it through the build script, and ports independent Ycaro login/session routes without replacing the stable Lucca implementation.
- The release branch preserves shared chat history: Ycaro login, logout, and expiry do not delete messages. The frontend sends/persists/clears its separate `upstatus_ycaro_token`.
- GitHub Actions `UpStatus Validate` run #100 passed for PR #18 head `5be9f8f2e5a2825aa1dc6fe3d26092f46bbb4d23`. The source preflight also confirmed the route, secret lookup, separate session, frontend token handling, and absence of Ycaro message deletion. This is not a live browser/login test.
- Vercel preview check `upstatus-ycaro` still fails with the known `STATIC_BUILD_NO_OUT_DIR` / missing `public` output directory configuration. Lucca's Vercel check passes. Do not change Vercel settings as part of this release; the corrected Ycaro HTML should be manually redeployed using the known manual-upload path after backend release approval.
- Production remains unchanged: Supabase Edge Function `upstatus` is ACTIVE version 394 and still serves backend version `3.0.31` without Ycaro routes. The live Ycaro Vercel alias still serves the older frontend and is not yet functional against production.
- The user reports setting `YCARO_PASSWORD` in the Supabase Dashboard, but the connected tools cannot verify secret names. Before deployment, confirm that the secret name exists in the Dashboard; never ask for or expose its value.
- PR #17 remains open against `develop`; its latest head `ec49a99c45068ff930a1ba62057c0fc0df913a1e` has a successful `UpStatus Validate` run, while its Ycaro Vercel preview check fails for the same project output-directory configuration.
- No PR was merged and no production function or frontend deployment was performed after the stable-version mismatch was discovered. Next step: review PR #18, verify the secret name in Dashboard, and only then follow the explicitly approved release sequence.

## Open items

- No known user-reported call bug is currently open; user said calls are working perfectly.
- Continuity documentation PR #13 was merged into `develop` as `b0f4bed3f635d6b6a68c1898286cd519907b632d`.
- Consider adding a link to these documents from README in a later small documentation change; the permanent prompt is already available in `docs/PROJECT_GUIDE.md`.
- Before any future WebRTC change, re-check current browser behavior and consider TURN only if real networks still fail.

## Bonfire note

The current chat is establishing durable continuity docs so a new chat can continue without rebuilding the whole conversation. The permanent prompt is in `docs/PROJECT_GUIDE.md`. The continuity docs are merged into `develop`. No production deployment was performed for this documentation-only change. At the start of the next task, read the guide and this file, then verify live repository and runtime state before implementation.
